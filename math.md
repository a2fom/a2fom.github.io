# Math equations

When \\(a \ne 0\\), there are two solutions to \\(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\\) and they are
\\(x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}\\).

\\[x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.\\]

<p>
$$
\min_{x \in \mathbb{R}^n , y\in \mathbb{R}^m } ~ R(x) + J(y)  \quad
\textrm{such that} \quad Ax + By = b  ,
$$
